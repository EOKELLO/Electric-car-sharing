# Electric-car-sharing

In this project i seek to process stations data to understand electric car usage over time by solving for the following research question;

Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018

I will be using python programming language spefically i will use 

pandas and numpy for data cleaning and manipulation

This project will help customers to know which station is ideal for them to get the services.
